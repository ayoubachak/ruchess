# Chess Game Refactoring

This document outlines the major refactoring changes made to the chess game codebase to fix issues with the board implementation and piece movement, and to prepare for multiplayer integration.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Board Representation**: 
   - Replaced inconsistent board representation with a proper `ChessBoard` struct
   - Fixed indexing issues in board access
   - Standardized the representation format

2. **Piece Movement**:
   - Fixed the `add_line_moves` function that had incorrect indexing
   - Implemented proper boundary checking for all piece movements
   - Simplified and clarified piece movement logic
   - Added helper methods to improve code readability

3. **Game State Management**:
   - Implemented persistent game state using a global mutex
   - Added proper turn-based gameplay logic
   - Integrated selected square and possible moves tracking

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Improved type definitions with proper traits
   - Enhanced error handling for moves and selections
   - Standardized public interfaces for better maintainability

## Key Architectural Improvements

### 1. ChessBoard Implementation

The new `ChessBoard` implementation provides:
- Clear ownership of squares and pieces
- Well-defined interfaces for move validation
- Proper encapsulation of board representation details
- Methods to calculate valid moves for any piece

### 2. Position Handling

Added a robust Position struct with:
- Safe position delta calculations
- Boundary checking
- Clear coordinate representation

### 3. Game State Management

Implemented a thread-safe game state that:
- Persists between commands
- Tracks the current player
- Maintains game progression
- Can be reset for new games

### 4. API Design for Multiplayer

The refactored code is now ready for multiplayer integration with:
- Well-defined command interfaces
- Proper state serialization with serde
- Clear separation of concerns
- Stateful game progression

## Next Steps for Multiplayer

To implement multiplayer functionality:

1. **Network Communication Layer**: 
   - Add WebSocket support to the Tauri app
   - Implement game room creation and joining

2. **State Synchronization**:
   - Create a protocol for state updates
   - Implement state merging for networked games

3. **Player Management**:
   - Add player identification and authentication
   - Implement player session management

4. **Move Validation**:
   - Ensure moves are validated on the server side
   - Implement proper turn enforcement

5. **Game Persistence**:
   - Add database storage for game history
   - Implement game saving and loading

The refactored code provides a solid foundation for these enhancements, with clear data structures and separation of concerns that will facilitate multiplayer implementation.
